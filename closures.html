        <!-- 
            Closures in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables 
            3 scope chains:-
            1. has access to its own scope, i.e. the variables defined within its curly braces.
            2. has access to the variables of the outer functions.
            3. has access to the global variables.
