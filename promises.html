<!-- 
    * JavaScript is predominantly single threaded: 
        : All processes continues the processes in single sequence.
        : This makes it slow and restrictive
    * With the help of promises and other Asynchronous concept.
    * JavaScript can perform long network requests simultaneously without blocking the main thread.
